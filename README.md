Minimal VkCreateInstance in Vlang

# Run
Vulkan shared library symbols are loaded from libvulkan.so.1 or vulkan-1.dll,
so make sure to add the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, like

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"`

Then you can clone and run with

`git clone https://github.com/antono2/tmp; cd tmp; v run .`
